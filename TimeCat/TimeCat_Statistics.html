   The results are listed numerically, as percentages, and as pie charts.
Classification can be done by importance, by state, and by tag, as selected by the buttons at the bottom of the screen.
If a task has multiple tags, it is counted once for each of the tags in the tag-based statistics.
{ToDo: If the number of slices in the pie charts exceed the number of colors specified in
   <a href="TimeCat_Settings.html">
    settings
   </a>
   , the first N-1 slices would correspond to the highest percentages, while slice N will contain the sum of the smaller percentages.}
  </p>
  <p>
   {ToDo: Even if the maximum number of tasks displayed in a
   <a href="TimeCat_Lists.html">
    list
   </a>
   is limited in
   <a href="TimeCat_Settings.html">
    settings
   </a>
   , the statistics is performed on all the tasks satisfying the
   <a href="TimeCat_Search.html">
    search criteria
   </a>
   for the list.}
