<p>Lists of tasks are results of <a href="https://www.timecat.info/wiki/index.php/TimeCat:Search" title="TimeCat:Search">searches</a> in the task database.
There are two standard lists: active and completed.<br />
The active tasks are current if the deadline is in the future. They become expired when the current time goes past the deadline. 
Additionally to the standard lists, the user can define <a href="https://www.timecat.info/wiki/index.php?title=Help:Search&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Help:Search (page does not exist)">new search criteria</a> resulting in custom lists.
{ToDo: For application responsiveness purposes, the maximum number of tasks displayed in a list is limited in <a href="https://www.timecat.info/wiki/index.php/TimeCat:Settings" title="TimeCat:Settings">settings</a>.} 
All the lists have a common interface described below.<br />
</p><p>Tasks are represented in a list by the name and an information field.<br />
The information field lists:
</p>
<ul><li> the remaining time until the deadline for the active tasks;
</li><li> the expiration time for the expired tasks; 
</li><li> the completion time for the completed tasks.
</li></ul>
<p>The order of the tasks in the active list is given by a score determined
by the priority of the task and by the percentage of the time remaining to completion 
if the deadline is in the future. (check if true!!)
{ToDo: Figure out the formula}
</p><p>The order of the tasks in the completed list is given 
by completion time.
</p><p>The order of the tasks in a custom list is given by the <a href="https://www.timecat.info/wiki/index.php/TimeCat:Search" title="TimeCat:Search">search criteria</a> defined by that list.
</p><p>{ToDo: A custom list can be forgotten or <a href="https://www.timecat.info/wiki/index.php/TimeCat:Sharing" title="TimeCat:Sharing">exported</a> using the "Forget Search" and "Export Search" entries in the main menu (or maybe make buttons).
When a custom list is exported, the search criteria are shared, and not the tasks in the resulting list.
To export the tasks, please use the "Block operations".}
</p><p>The operations that can be performed from the list screen are listed below:
</p><p><b>Add a new task:</b>
Touching the <a href="https://www.timecat.info/wiki/index.php/File:Ic_action_new.png" class="image" title="x"><img alt="x" src="/wiki/images/thumb/7/7b/Ic_action_new.png/24px-Ic_action_new.png" width="24" height="24" /></a> icon on the top bar creates a new task 
and opens the <a href="https://www.timecat.info/wiki/index.php/TimeCat:Tasks" title="TimeCat:Tasks">edit screen</a> for it.
The menu generated by a long touch on an existing task allows
to generate a new task with a higher priority than the current one.
</p><p><b><a href="https://www.timecat.info/wiki/index.php/TimeCat:Tasks" title="TimeCat:Tasks">Edit</a> an existing task:</b>
Touching the task in any list opens the <a href="https://www.timecat.info/wiki/index.php/TimeCat:Tasks" title="TimeCat:Tasks">edit screen</a>.
</p><p><b>Delete a task:</b>
Swiping right to left over a task shows a quick delete button.
{ToDo: cancel the delete button}
Deleted tasks cannot be recovered.
Other ways to delete the task is using the menu generated by
a long touch, or through the block operations.
</p><p><b>Move a task:</b>
Swiping left to right over a task toggles on and off the "complete" status. 
Alternatively, the task can be marked as completed or active 
from the <a href="https://www.timecat.info/wiki/index.php/TimeCat:Tasks" title="TimeCat:Tasks">edit</a> screen.
Another way to move the task between lists is using the menu generated by
a long touch.

Tasks can be reordered by changing the priority or the deadline
in the &lt;edit&gt; screen.

Touching the <a href="https://www.timecat.info/wiki/index.php/File:Ic_action_group_w.png" class="image" title="x"><img alt="x" src="/wiki/images/thumb/3/38/Ic_action_group_w.png/24px-Ic_action_group_w.png" width="24" height="24" /></a> icon again cancels the block mode.
