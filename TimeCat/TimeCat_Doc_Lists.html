    Organizing tasks in lists
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Lists of tasks are results of
   <a href="TimeCat_Search.html">
    searches
   </a>
   in the task database.
There are two standard lists: active and completed.
   <br/>
   The active tasks are current if the deadline is in the future. They become expired when the current time goes past the deadline. 
Additionally to the standard lists, the user can define
   <a class="new" href="index.php?title=Help_Search&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html">
    new search criteria
   </a>
   resulting in custom lists.
{ToDo: For application responsiveness purposes, the maximum number of tasks displayed in a list is limited in
   <a href="TimeCat_Settings.html">
    settings
   </a>
   .} 
All the lists have a common interface described below.
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Tasks are represented in a list by the name and an information field.
   <br/>
   The information field lists:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    the remaining time until the deadline for the active tasks;
   </li>
   <li>
    the expiration time for the expired tasks;
   </li>
   <li>
    the completion time for the completed tasks.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The order of the tasks in the active list is given by a score determined
by the priority of the task and by the percentage of the time remaining to completion 
if the deadline is in the future. (check if true!!)
{ToDo: Figure out the formula}
  </p>
  <p>
   The order of the tasks in the completed list is given 
by completion time.
  </p>
  <p>
   The order of the tasks in a custom list is given by the
   <a href="TimeCat_Search.html">
    search criteria
   </a>
   defined by that list.
  </p>
  <p>
   {ToDo: A custom list can be forgotten or
   <a href="TimeCat_Sharing.html">
    exported
   </a>
   using the "Forget Search" and "Export Search" entries in the main menu (or maybe make buttons).
When a custom list is exported, the search criteria are shared, and not the tasks in the resulting list.
To export the tasks, please use the "Block operations".}
  </p>
  <p>
   The operations that can be performed from the list screen are listed below:
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Add a new task:
   </b>
   Touching the
   <img src="images/24px-Ic_action_new.png"/>
   icon on the top bar creates a new task 
and opens the
   <a href="TimeCat_Tasks.html">
    edit screen
   </a>
   for it.
The menu generated by a long touch on an existing task allows
to generate a new task with a higher priority than the current one.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    <a href="TimeCat_Tasks.html">
     Edit
    </a>
    an existing task:
   </b>
   Touching the task in any list opens the
   <a href="TimeCat_Tasks.html">
    edit screen
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Delete a task:
   </b>
   Swiping right to left over a task shows a quick delete button.
{ToDo: cancel the delete button}
Deleted tasks cannot be recovered.
Other ways to delete the task is using the menu generated by
a long touch, or through the block operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Move a task:
   </b>
   Swiping left to right over a task toggles on and off the "complete" status. 
Alternatively, the task can be marked as completed or active 
from the
   <a href="TimeCat_Tasks.html">
    edit
   </a>
   screen.
Another way to move the task between lists is using the menu generated by
a long touch.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Reorder tasks:
   </b>
   Tasks can be reordered by changing the priority or the deadline
in the &lt;edit&gt; screen.
{ToDo: Tasks can be reordered by dragging them vertically in the list.}
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Block operations:
   </b>
   By using the
   <img src="images/24px-Ic_action_group_w.png"/>
   icon, tasks can be selected to perform block operations 
like deletion, complete/uncomplete, select/unselect all, {ToDo
   <a href="TimeCat_Sharing.html">
    export
   </a>
   }.
Touching the
   <img src="images/24px-Ic_action_group_w.png"/>
   icon again cancels the block mode.
  </p>

  <h2>
   <span class="mw-headline" id="Search_and_Custom_lists">
    Search and Custom lists
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Lists are results of searches in the database of tasks as following:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    the Active list contains all tasks in the Active or Expired state;
   </li>
   <li>
    the Comppleted list contains all tasks in the Comppleted state;
   </li>
   <li>
    a Custom list contains all tasks resulted from a custom search.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   To create a new search, touch "New Search" under the "Custom Lists" menu.
The last 3{-6 maybe option in settings} sets of search criteria are stored under the "Custom Lists" menu under the desired names.
The searches not listed under "Custom Lists" are forgotten.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each time an existing search is selected, a new search is conducted using the selected criteria.
  </p>
  <p>
   A new search is based on a set of parameters explained below:
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    List Name
   </b>
   is the name of the new search and of the list generated by it.
   <br/>
   Mandatory.
   <br/>
   Default: empty
   <br/>
   Filter: {ToDo}
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Order By
   </b>
   specifies the parameter to be used for ordering the new list.
   <br/>
   Possible values: Priority, State, Task Name
   <br/>
   Default: Priority
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Importance
   </b>
   specifies the importance of the included tasks.
   <br/>
   Possible values: Any, LOW, MODERATE, IMPORTANT, CRUCIAL
   <br/>
   Default: Any
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Tags
   </b>
   specifies the list of tags included on the list.
   <br/>
   Default: {all tags}
  </p>
  <p>
   {ToDo:
   <b>
    Deadline between ... and ...
   </b>
   selects tasks based on deadlines.
   <br/>
   Default = all deadlines}
  </p>
  <p>
   {ToDo:
   <b>
    Created between... and ...
   </b>
   selects tasks based on the time when they were created.
   <br/>
   Default = all times}
  </p>
  <h2>
   <span class="mw-headline" id="Statistics_on_lists">
    Statistics on lists
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Statistics can be built based on the properties of the tasks {ToDo: from the current list}.
By touching the {piechart} button in the
   <a href="TimeCat_Lists.html">
    list
   </a>
   , the statistics is generated from all the tasks selected by the search criteria of the list.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Statistics presentation
   </b>
   The results are listed numerically, as percentages, and as pie charts.
Classification can be done by importance, by state, and by tag, as selected by the buttons at the bottom of the screen.
If a task has multiple tags, it is counted once for each of the tags in the tag-based statistics.
{ToDo: If the number of slices in the pie charts exceed the number of colors specified in
   <a href="TimeCat_Settings.html">
    settings
   </a>
   , the first N-1 slices would correspond to the highest percentages, while slice N will contain the sum of the smaller percentages.}
  </p>
  <p>
   {ToDo: Even if the maximum number of tasks displayed in a
   <a href="TimeCat_Lists.html">
    list
   </a>
   is limited in
   <a href="TimeCat_Settings.html">
    settings
   </a>
   , the statistics is performed on all the tasks satisfying the
